        "content": "From 20–30 September 2025, Estonian radio amateurs came together on the airwaves to celebrate the 90th anniversary of the Estonian Radio Amateurs Union (ERAU). To mark this milestone, a special event callsign ES90ERAU was active throughout the country, operated by many Estonian hams who joined the effort to make the jubilee memorable and widely heard across the bands. \n\n During the 10-day celebration, operators made thousands of QSOs with stations from all around the world, promoting Estonian amateur radio and honoring nine decades of organized amateur radio activity in Estonia. \n\n Among the active operators was ES2OA, who contributed to the event with around 150 QSOs. It was a rewarding experience filled with pileups, friendly contacts, and a shared sense of national pride in ERAU’s long and vibrant history.\n\nCongratulations to ERAU on 90 years of service to the amateur radio community — here’s to many more years of innovation, friendship, and radio adventure!"
