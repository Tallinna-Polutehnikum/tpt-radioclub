To mark this milestone, a special event callsign ES90ERAU was active throughout the country, operated by many Estonian hams who joined the effort to make the jubilee memorable and widely heard across the bands.</p> <p>During the 10-day celebration, operators made thousands of QSOs with stations from all around the world, promoting Estonian amateur radio and honoring nine decades of organized amateur radio activity in Estonia.</p> <p>Among the active operators was ES2OA, who contributed to the event with around 150 QSOs. It was a rewarding experience filled with pileups, friendly contacts, and a shared sense of national pride in ERAU’s long and vibrant history.</p> <p>Congratulations to ERAU on 90 years of service to the amateur radio community — here’s to many more years of innovation, friendship, and radio adventure!</p>"
